# Introduction

In the following pages I'll explain in detail my wishes for Warcraft III.

## Background

I've played Warcraft 3 since 2004 and started my first mapping projects around 2005-2006.
In 2007 I've had around 100 self-created maps (Tree Tag-like, TDs, Custom Melee, Escapes, etc).
During this whole time I was very active both in custom maps and melee. 

There have been countless custom maps that I've played and loved. From the top of my head:

* Battle For Atlantis Gold (Anyone remember?), The Great Strategy, DotA
* Sheep Tag, Tree Tag & alike
* Vulcano Escape, Ice Escap
* Maze Maker, Escape Editor (Extreme)
* Elimination Tournament

# Gameplay

# Platforms

I've bought Warcraft 3 RoC + TFT about 14 years ago and played it extensively on Windows XP, Windows Vista and latest Windows 7.
