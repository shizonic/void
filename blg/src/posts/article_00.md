### Introduction

I'm Anachron and I'm currently on [VoidLinux](https://www.voidlinux.eu/).

#### Myself

I love linux and everything releated to DYI/KISS, such as [suckless](https://suckless.org/) and [containers](https://github.com/arachsys/containers).

If I am not writing scripts to make my life easier I'm probably [ricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) my desktop or play [n++](http://www.nplusplus.org/).

You can find me on [github](https://github.com/Anachron) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/AnachronGuy).

#### Blog

This blog is generated using [smag](https://github.com/Anachron/smag), a simple static website generator based on [lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/), [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/), [spectre](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/), [highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/) and [rwc](https://github.com/chneukirchen/rwc).

In the future you'll find more about `Void Linux`, `ricing`  and `minimalism` here.
